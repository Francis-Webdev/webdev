<p>I hope you're doing well! I just wanted to take a moment to let you know how much I appreciate having you in my life. It’s not every day you come across someone who truly makes things better just by being around.
</p>
<p>Whether we’re laughing over something silly or just having a chill conversation, I always look forward to the time we spend together. You’re one of those people who makes everything feel easier, and I can’t tell you how much that means to me.
</p>
I just wanted to say thanks for being you. You make life a lot more fun, and I’m really grateful for your friendship.

Hope we can catch up soon!</em>
